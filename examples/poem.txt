# Excerpt from 'The Raven' by Edgar Allan Poe

but the Raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only
that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour
nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered
till I scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before
on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
then the bird said Nevermore
